Tic-Tac-Toe For Kids

A group of researchers are studying how young children take turns when playing games. As 
part of that research, this program is provided as a prototype of a "free form" graphical 
Tic-Tac-Toe game in which the two players can freely alternate turns.

Design constraints:

   1. The game is intended for kids ages 5-7.
   2. The game was written in C++.
   3. The game is supposed to build and run on the Linux platform as found in the PSU CS 
        Linux Laboratory.
   4. The game is graphical designed.
         1. The game is two-player.
               1. Strong visual indication is given as to simulate a player turn at any given time.
               2. A player is allowed to play out-of-turn, with reasonable results, and without penalty.
         2. A strong visual indication as to the state of the game (X wins, O wins, draw, or in-progress) is checked at all times.
               1. When the game is over, any UI action will start a new game.
               2. The game can be declared over, and a draw, at the earliest time that neither player could possibly win, regardless of future play.
   5. Extra features:
         1. Visually appealing graphics: attractive images are used to encourage the children to play.
         2. Full screen mode: Game board will be centerized.
